A simple a database system that can effectively retrieve new data from the internet as well as through local insertion, and query through the data by using customized multimap BST classes.

This project was specced by Carey Nachenberg to be the final project for UCLA's CS32 course (Data Structures & Algorithms in C++). I completed the project as a means to practice creating complex data structures (for this project I implemented a multimap BST class) as well as efficient searching and sorting algorithms. In order to properly implement the database system, I built a simple set of C++ classes:
    - MultiMap
    - Database

A simple description of each class, what it is and how it works, is commented on their respective header files.
