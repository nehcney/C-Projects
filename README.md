A simple a database system that can effectively retrieve new data from the internet as well as through local insertion, and query through the data by using customized multimap BST classes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was specced by Carey Nachenberg to be the final project for UCLA's 2014 CS32 course (Data Structures & Algorithms in C++). I was not enrolled in that course, but I completed this project as a means to practice creating complex data structures (for this project I implemented a multimap BST class) as well as efficient searching and sorting algorithms. In order to properly implement the database system, I built a simple set of C++ classes:
    - MultiMap
    - Database

A simple description of each class, what it is and how it works, is commented on their respective header files.
