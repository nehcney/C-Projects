# Database Project
An in-memory database that supports queries across multiple keys and arbitrary ordering of results.

## Summary
I completed this project as a means to practice creating complex data structures (for this project I implemented a multimap BST class) as well as efficient searching and sorting algorithms. In order to properly implement the database system, I built a simple set of C++ classes:
-   MultiMap
-   Database

A simple description of each class, what it is and how it works, is commented on their respective header files.

## Full Specs
